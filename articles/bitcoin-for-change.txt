For the past few weeks I have been wanting to write an article about Bitcoin, but was not really sure what to write about.  There are so many aspects to bitcoin, so many pros and cons, that its near impossible to cover everything in one article.  If you are new to bitcoin then I would highly recommend  [weusecoins](http://www.weusecoins.com/en/) as a good place to start and if you are in the market to buy then you may want to head over to [QuickBitcoin](https://quickbitcoin.co.uk).

I see a lot of articles on hacker news about the pros and cons of bitcoins (articles are normally strongly weighted one way or the other, but with approximately equal numbers on each side).  The very fact of it is, there are a lot of pros, and a lot of cons to bitcoin.  [Santoshi](https://www.google.ca/search?q=santoshi&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ei=6krDUqC5Nc74oATxnIKIDQ&ved=0CAkQ_AUoAQ&biw=1440&bih=802) is clearly a genius, but no system is created without flaws.  While its nice to see mature discussions on Hacker News and Reddit, I think a lot of people are missing an important point.

Everyone is focused around the idea that bitcoin is either good or bad.  It will either succeed or fail.  It will replace traditional currency, or it will not.  What people often miss, is that bitcoins most important virtue is that it is bringing about a change to the way we think about financial assets.  Whether it is currency, shares, property rights, deposits; bitcoin is changing the way we think about managing these assets, and removing a central authority from all of them.
