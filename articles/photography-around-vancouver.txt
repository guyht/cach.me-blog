Although I have always been interested in photography, I have never really written about it.  My setup is by no means professional, but I feel that I have enough to get a fairly decent pictures from it.  I have a [Nikon D5200](http://en.nikon.ca/Nikon-Products/Product/Digital-SLR-Cameras/1501/D5200.html) with an [18-55mm stock lens](http://www.dpreview.com/lensreviews/nikon_18-55_3p5-5p6_vr_n15) which is actually ok for quick snaps, a [70-300mm](http://www.dpreview.com/news/2006/8/9/nikonafs70-300vrlens) and a [55mm prime](http://www.dpreview.com/lensreviews/nikon_35_1p8g_n15) which is amazing!  I also have a Pentax 1.8 55mm prime which I use with an adapter ring.

All my photos can be seen on Flickr at [http://www.flickr.com/photos/guyht/](http://www.flickr.com/photos/guyht/) and most of them are taken in and around the Vancouver area.

This was taken from Jericho beach with the Pentax 1.8 55mm prime.  Since the lens only has manual focus, I had to take a succession of 5-6 shots while adjusting the focus ring and picking the sharpest one.  While I have had good success with this technique, its a sure way to fill up your memory card with out of focus photos.

Taken at the Vancouver Aquarium with the 35m prime full open and a high iso of 1600 to give me a fast enough shutter speed of 1/80.  Most of the photos I took inside the aquarium got messed up by the thick glass in front of the tanks.  I managed to get this one by putting a hood on the 35mm prime, and pushing it right up against the glass so that no light could reflect off it.
