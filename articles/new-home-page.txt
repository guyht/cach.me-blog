After months of displaying the default install splash for Zend Framework, I decided it was time I had some sort of semblance of a home page. What I have put together is rushed to say the least and will <em>hopefully</em> see a large number of improvements over the next few weeks, but if you want to check it out, have a look at [http://www.cach.me](http://www.cach.me). At the moment it just contains some links to my social networking outlets but I intent to add an 'about', 'contact' and 'projects' section. It would be nice to be able to have something a bit more sophisticated, but I just dont have time at the moment. Most of the spare time I get in front of my computer at the moment is spent on a Mac App I am writing. Its very simple and I hope to get it submitted to the mac app store over the next couple of weeks. More details to come.
