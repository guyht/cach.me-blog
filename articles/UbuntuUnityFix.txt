I recently installed the latest version of Ubuntu on my VirtualBox setup, and
was disappointed to find that it was almost unusable because it was so slow.
It turns out this is due to Unity 2D no longer being included in Ubuntu (as of
12.10).  Instead Ubuntu 12.10 runs Unity under LLVM, meaning that, in the
absence of a GPU, the rendering code is run directly on the CPU.  This slows
the system down because a) the CPU has to render the graphics in addition to
its normal tasks and b) the CPU is not optimised for graphics rendering.  For
me (and many others), this makes using Ubuntu 12.10 in VirtualBox almost
impossible to use. 

Butâ€¦ here is how you can fix it:

Note, these instructions only work for **VirtualBox 4.2.4 or 4.2.6**, installed
from VirtualBox's website, not from Ubuntu's repo, and assume you have Ubuntu
12.10 already installed in your VirtualBox.

## 1 Check to see if your Ubuntu 12.10 guest has 3D acceleration enabled:

<code>
    $ /usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p
    
    Not software rendered:    no

    Not blacklisted:          yes

    GLX fbconfig:             yes

    GLX texture from pixmap:  yes

    GL npot or rect textures: yes

    GL vertex program:        yes

    GL fragment program:      yes

    GL vertex buffer object:  yes

    GL framebuffer object:    yes

    GL version is 1.4+:       yes

    Unity 3D supported:       no
</code>

If, "Not software rendered" and "Unity 3D supported" both return "no" as seen
above, then Ubuntu 12.10 is running Unity using LLVMpipe.


## 2 Install VirtualBox Oracle VM VirtualBox Extension Pack. (see
https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)

## 3 Install some required packages for the guest additions:

    `sudo apt-get install linux-headers-$(uname -r) build-essential`

## 4 Install the guest additions by clicking Devices, Install Guest Additions
and running this command from the CD-ROM's directory:

    `sudo ./VBoxLinuxAdditions.run`

## 5 Add the vboxvideo driver to your modules file:

    `sudo bash -c 'echo vboxvideo >> /etc/modules'`

## 6 Shutdown the Ubuntu instance.

## 7 Open the settings of the Ubuntu instance, navigate to "Display", and make
sure "Enable 3D acceleration" is selected.

## 8 Start your Ubuntu 12.10 instance, and check that its all working by
re-running the command:

    `/usr/lib/nux/unity_support_test -p`

**NOTE: If you perform an update, and your linux headers are updated, you will
need to repeat the above process**
