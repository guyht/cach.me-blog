Blogging with Wordpress has become boring and tiresome.  I have grown to dislike the clunky interface, the editor, and the way that however much you try to customize you blog, it still looks like just another Wordpress blog.

I decided to try to put together my own blog engine which would **only** do the bare minimum.  The idea behind **[Glog](https://github.com/guyht/Glog)** is to create a super simple and ultra minimalistic blog engine that has a tiny overhead and only the most basic features.  Although Glog is basic, it is also very powerful.  Here's why you might want to give it a shot.

- **Use the editor of your choice:**

- **Write in markdown:**

- **Go revision happy with git:**

- **Deploy in seconds:**

- **Lightweight:**

- **Entire site caching:**
