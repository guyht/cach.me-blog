Welcome to yet another boring blog, my previous attempts at maintaining a decent blog have failed miserably and I am sure that this one will follow suit. Most of the stuff posted here will be internet / coding related but will try to post some more interesting stuff as well.

I intend to use this blog as an outlet for some coding articles that I have been thinking about over the past few months, feel free to flame away.
