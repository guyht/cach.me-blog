I have redesigned the GitHub home page for my <a href="http://guyht.github.com/Giki/" target="_blank">Giki</a> project. Although my design skills are not anything to write home about, I think it looks ok, and its certainly a large improvement over what it looked like before.

One feature that I am particularly proud of is the <em>try me </em>button on the left hand side of the page. When clicked, a text box is transitioned onto the page (using a jquery animation) and the top part of the page can be edited in real time using Giki.

There is also a separate 'preview' box at the bottom of the page that allows you to render BBCode in real time into a div below it. Feel free to give it a go.

I have really enjoyed working on this software so far and I think it has a lot of potential, especially when combined with my <a href="https://github.com/guyht/GWorker" target="_blank">GWorker</a> library that makes the web workers backwards compatible with browsers that do not natively support them.

Am hoping to add a couple more features in the near future so keep an eye on it.
